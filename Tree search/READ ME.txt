	What it does
	Breadth first search is a type of search, where the search is 
done by checking each "row" of the binary tree until the item is found.
This program generates random numbers and puts them 
into the queue and the binary tree, so that 
using breadth first search, the program can check to see
if an item is in the tree. 

	How it works:
The program generates random numbers, enqueues them into the queue
as well as adds those random numbers into the binary tree, and then my 
driver test all of the possible cases, where it test the insert/delete
functions for queue and the binary tree, as well as it test the copy 
constructors for both queue and the binary tree, and most importantly, 
it test breadth first search and tells the user wether the item is 
found in the binary tree or not. 


	How to use it:
	First, the user has to compile this program on linux. 
For exmaple, the user has to type "make", since the 
makefile is already provided and hit enter. Afterwards, the 
user needs to type the following  to execute the program: "./treeSearch". 
Note , this program generates random numbers in order to be able to test the
program thoroughly. The results of my tests are outputted 
to the console output. 
 
	What works, what doesn't 
the queue can only hold a maximum of 1000 items.
